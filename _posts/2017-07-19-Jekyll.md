  Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.
    It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs 
    it through a converter (like [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) 
    and our [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) renderer, and spits out a 
    complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. 
    Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki),
    which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from 
    GitHub’s servers for free. <!--more-->

## [Quick-start guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/)
If you already have a full [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) development environment 
    with all headers and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) installed (see 
    Jekyll’s [requirements](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements)), you can create a 
    new Jekyll site by doing the following:
    
~~~shell
# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems through RubyGems
~ $ gem install jekyll bundler

# Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog
~ $ jekyll new myblog

# Change into your new directory
~ $ cd myblog

# Build the site on the preview server
~/myblog $ bundle exec jekyll serve

# Now browse to http://localhost:4000
~~~

## [Basic Usage](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/)
The Jekyll gem makes a `jekyll` executable available to you in your Terminal window. You can use 
    this command in a number of ways:
    
~~~shell
$ jekyll build
# => The current folder will be generated into ./_site

$ jekyll build --destination <destination>
# => The current folder will be generated into <destination>

$ jekyll build --source <source> --destination <destination>
# => The <source> folder will be generated into <destination>

$ jekyll build --watch
# => The current folder will be generated into ./_site,
#    watched for changes, and regenerated automatically.
~~~

Jekyll also comes with a built-in development server that will allow you to preview what the 
    generated site will look like in your browser locally.
    
~~~shell
$ jekyll serve
# => A development server will run at http://localhost:4000/
# Auto-regeneration: enabled. Use `--no-watch` to disable.

$ jekyll serve --detach
# => Same as `jekyll serve` but will detach from the current terminal.
#    If you need to kill the server, you can `kill -9 1234` where "1234" is the PID.
#    If you cannot find the PID, then do, `ps aux | grep jekyll` and kill the instance.
~~~

These are just a few of the available [configuration options](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/).
    Many configuration options can either be specified as flags on the command line, or alternatively 
    (and more commonly) they can be specified in a `_config.yml` file at the root of the source directory.
    Jekyll will automatically use the options from this file when run. For example, if you place the 
    following lines in your `_config.yml` file:
    


Then the following two commands will be equivalent:

~~~shell
$ jekyll build
$ jekyll build --source _source --destination _deploy
~~~

## [Directory structure](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/)
Jekyll is, at its core, a text transformation engine. The concept behind the system is this: 
    you give it text written in your favorite markup language, be that Markdown, Textile, or 
    just plain HTML, and it churns that through a layout or a series of layout files. Throughout 
    that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in 
    the layout, and more. This is all done through editing text files; the static web site is the 
    final product.

A basic Jekyll site usually looks something like this:

~~~shell
.
├── _config.yml
├── _data
|   └── members.yml
├── _drafts
|   ├── begin-with-the-crazy-ideas.md
|   └── on-simplicity-in-technology.md
├── _includes
|   ├── footer.html
|   └── header.html
├── _layouts
|   ├── default.html
|   └── post.html
├── _posts
|   ├── 2007-10-29-why-every-programmer-should-play-nethack.md
|   └── 2009-04-26-barcamp-boston-4-roundup.md
├── _sass
|   ├── _base.scss
|   └── _layout.scss
├── _site
├── .jekyll-metadata
└── index.html # can also be an 'index.md' with valid YAML Frontmatter
~~~

An overview of what each of these does:

| File / Directory |                               Description                                    |
|:----------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|`_config.yml`     |Stores [configuration](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) data. Many of these options can be specified from the command line executable but it’s easier to specify them here so you don’t have to remember them.|
|`_drafts`         |Drafts are unpublished posts. The format of these files is without a date: `title.MARKUP`. Learn how to [work with drafts](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/).|
|`_includes`       |These are the partials that can be mixed and matched by your layouts and posts to facilitate reuse. The liquid tag `{% include file.ext %}` can be used to include the partial in `_includes/file.ext`.|
|`_layouts`        |These are the templates that wrap posts. Layouts are chosen on a post-by-post basis in the [YAML Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), which is described in the next section. The liquid tag `{{ content }}` is used to inject content into the web page.|
