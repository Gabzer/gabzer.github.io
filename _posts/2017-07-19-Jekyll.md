  [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.
    It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs 
    it through a converter (like [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) 
    and our [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) renderer, and spits out a 
    complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. 
    Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki),
    which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from 
    GitHub’s servers for free. <!--more-->

## [Quick-start guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/)
If you already have a full [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) development environment 
    with all headers and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) installed (see 
    Jekyll’s [requirements](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements)), you can create a 
    new Jekyll site by doing the following:
    
~~~shell
# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems through RubyGems
~ $ gem install jekyll bundler

# Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog
~ $ jekyll new myblog

# Change into your new directory
~ $ cd myblog

# Build the site on the preview server
~/myblog $ bundle exec jekyll serve

# Now browse to http://localhost:4000
~~~

## [Basic Usage](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/)
The Jekyll gem makes a `jekyll` executable available to you in your Terminal window. You can use 
    this command in a number of ways:
    
~~~shell
$ jekyll build
# => The current folder will be generated into ./_site

$ jekyll build --destination <destination>
# => The current folder will be generated into <destination>

$ jekyll build --source <source> --destination <destination>
# => The <source> folder will be generated into <destination>

$ jekyll build --watch
# => The current folder will be generated into ./_site,
#    watched for changes, and regenerated automatically.
~~~

Jekyll also comes with a built-in development server that will allow you to preview what the 
    generated site will look like in your browser locally.
    
~~~shell
$ jekyll serve
# => A development server will run at http://localhost:4000/
# Auto-regeneration: enabled. Use `--no-watch` to disable.

$ jekyll serve --detach
# => Same as `jekyll serve` but will detach from the current terminal.
#    If you need to kill the server, you can `kill -9 1234` where "1234" is the PID.
#    If you cannot find the PID, then do, `ps aux | grep jekyll` and kill the instance.
~~~

These are just a few of the available [configuration options](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/).
    Many configuration options can either be specified as flags on the command line, or alternatively 
    (and more commonly) they can be specified in a `_config.yml` file at the root of the source directory.
    Jekyll will automatically use the options from this file when run. For example, if you place the 
    following lines in your `_config.yml` file:
    
~~~markdown
source:      _source
destination: _deploy
~~~

Then the following two commands will be equivalent:

~~~shell
$ jekyll build
$ jekyll build --source _source --destination _deploy
~~~

## [Directory structure](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/)
Jekyll is, at its core, a text transformation engine. The concept behind the system is this: 
    you give it text written in your favorite markup language, be that Markdown, Textile, or 
    just plain HTML, and it churns that through a layout or a series of layout files. Throughout 
    that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in 
    the layout, and more. This is all done through editing text files; the static web site is the 
    final product.

A basic Jekyll site usually looks something like this:

~~~shell
.
├── _config.yml
├── _data
|   └── members.yml
├── _drafts
|   ├── begin-with-the-crazy-ideas.md
|   └── on-simplicity-in-technology.md
├── _includes
|   ├── footer.html
|   └── header.html
├── _layouts
|   ├── default.html
|   └── post.html
├── _posts
|   ├── 2007-10-29-why-every-programmer-should-play-nethack.md
|   └── 2009-04-26-barcamp-boston-4-roundup.md
├── _sass
|   ├── _base.scss
|   └── _layout.scss
├── _site
├── .jekyll-metadata
└── index.html # can also be an 'index.md' with valid YAML Frontmatter
~~~

An overview of what each of these does:

| File / Directory |                               Description                                    |
|:-----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|`_config.yml`     |Stores [configuration](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) data. Many of these options can be specified from the command line executable but it’s easier to specify them here so you don’t have to remember them.|
|`_drafts`         |Drafts are unpublished posts. The format of these files is without a date: `title.MARKUP`. Learn how to [work with drafts](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/).|
|`_includes`       |These are the partials that can be mixed and matched by your layouts and posts to facilitate reuse. The liquid tag `{ % include file.ext % }` can be used to include the partial in `_includes/file.ext`.|
|`_layouts`        |These are the templates that wrap posts. Layouts are chosen on a post-by-post basis in the [YAML Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), which is described in the next section. The liquid tag `{ { content } }` is used to inject content into the web page.|
|`_posts`          |Your dynamic content, so to speak. The naming convention of these files is important, and must follow the format: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`. The [permalinks](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/) can be customized for each post, but the date and markup language are determined solely by the file name.|
|`_data`           |Well-formatted site data should be placed here. The Jekyll engine will autoload all data files (using either the `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.json` or `.csv` formats and extensions) in this directory, and they will be accessible via `site.data`. If there's a file `members.yml` under the directory, then you can access contents of the file through `site.data.members`.|
|`_sass`           |These are sass partials that can be imported into your `main.scss` which will then be processed into a single stylesheet `main.css` that defines the styles to be used by your site.|
|`_site`           |This is where the generated site will be placed (by default) once Jekyll is done transforming it. It’s probably a good idea to add this to your `.gitignore` file.|
|`.jekyll-metadata`|This helps Jekyll keep track of which files have not been modified since the site was last built, and which files will need to be regenerated on the next build. This file will not be included in the generated site. It’s probably a good idea to add this to your `.gitignore` file.|
|`index.html` or `index.md` and other HTML, Markdown, Textile files|Provided that the file has a [YAML Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) section, it will be transformed by Jekyll. The same will happen for any `.html`, `.markdown`, `.md`, or `.textile` file in your site’s root directory or directories not listed above.|
|Other Files/Folders|Every other directory and file except for those listed above—such as `css` and `images` folders, `favicon.ico` files, and so forth—will be copied verbatim to the generated site. There are plenty of [sites already using Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/sites/) if you’re curious to see how they’re laid out.|
